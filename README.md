**Project Objective**

The objective of this project was to analyze a European pharmacy distributor operating across 8 countries and help stakeholders understand:

- Sales & profitability performance by country, region, and pharmacy

- Product and brand contribution to revenue and margin

- Regional impact on overall business performance

- Seasonal and promotional effects on profitability

The dashboard was designed for executive-level stakeholders, focusing on margin, geographic performance, and operational efficiency.

- NeuroMed Antidepressant 100 mg
- DermRx Insulin Pen 200 mg
- AntiBioX Inhaler 200 mg
- NeuroMed Inhaler 10 mg
- RxNova Antibiotic 100 g

Key Insight
- The top 10 products generate ~14x more revenue than the bottom 10.

**Bottom-performing products** 
- VitaCare Antacid 10 mg
- DermRx Soft Sunscreen Bright

**Promotion Impact Analysis**

Only 10.3% of sales are promotional.
Business is not highly promotion-driven
Demand appears stable and necessity-based
Discounts are not the primary revenue driver

**Generic vs Branded Preference**
Yes (Prefer Generic): 14.28%
No (Prefer Branded): 85.72%

This suggests:

Brand trust is critical in pharmaceutical purchasing
Pricing strategy may support premium positioning
Generic expansion has limited short-term upside

**Top Performing Pharmacies**
Leading contributors include Milan, Hamburg, Utrecht, Lyon, and Munich.

These locations show:

High sales and strong unit turnover
Stable ~28% profit margins
Strong results are concentrated in major economic hubs, indicating demand strength rather than pricing differences.

Key Insight:

Margin consistency across top branches suggests standardized pricing, stable cost control, and strong operational discipline.

**Below-Average Pharmacies**
These include Vienna, Bruges, Poznań, Bilbao, and Rome.

These locations show:
- Lower sales volume
- Reduced product turnover
- Margins slightly lower but still stable
- Underperformance appears volume-driven, not margin-driven, indicating weaker local demand rather than pricing issues.

Stronger pharmacies are concentrated in large economic hubs and dense urban regions.
Weaker branches tend to be in smaller or lower-demand markets.



**This project demonstrates**:

- Multi-level drill-down analysis (Country → Region → Pharmacy)
- Margin-focused performance evaluation
- Geographic performance clustering
- Category & brand portfolio optimization thinking
- Promotion impact evaluation
- Business storytelling with data
