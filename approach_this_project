#Project Approach

1️. Business-First Thinking
I approached this project from a business strategy perspective rather than a visualization-first mindset.
Before building dashboards, I defined the core executive questions:

What drives revenue?
What drives profit?
Where is margin pressure coming from?
Which regions and pharmacies underperform?
Is growth volume-driven or pricing-driven?
This ensured that the data model and measures were built around decision-making, not visuals.

2️. Data Modeling Strategy
I implemented a simplified star-schema model to ensure scalability, clarity, and performance.

Fact Table
This table captures transactional-level sales performance.

Dimension Tables
DimDate
DimProduct
DimPharmacy

This structure ensures:
Clean one-to-many relationships
Clear filtering logic
No ambiguous joins
High performance for aggregation

3️. Measure-Driven Design (DAX Logic)

Instead of relying on calculated columns, I used DAX measures for dynamic analysis:
Core Measures:
Sales
Cost
Profit
Profit %
UnitSold
PromoSales
MoM %

I also created:
Pharmacy Sale Status classification (Good / Below Avg)
Parameter table for dynamic metric switching

This allowed:
Flexible KPI toggling
Dynamic comparison logic
Scalable model expansion

4️. Analytical Framework
I structured the analysis in four layers:

Step 1 – Revenue Structure
Sales by Country
Sales by Product
Sales by Pharmacy

Brand concentration analysis
Goal: Identify revenue concentration and geographic dependency.
Step 2 – Profitability & Margin Analysis
Sales vs Cost comparison
Profit % stability
High-revenue / low-margin detection
Promotion impact analysis
Goal: Determine whether growth is sustainable and margin-secure.

Step 3 – Geographic & Operational Performance
Pharmacy-level performance benchmarking
Regional clustering
Volume vs Margin comparison
Underperforming branch identification
Goal: Evaluate operational execution consistency.

Step 4 – Product Portfolio Optimization
Top 10 vs Bottom 10 comparison
Brand dominance detection
Long-tail product analysis
Generic vs branded preference evaluation
Goal: Assess portfolio concentration and optimization opportunities.
